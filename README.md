A food delivery website build with mongodb, express, reactjs and nodejs.

# üí°About this project 

I built full responsive and modern food delivery website. In this project you can go to home page, menu, mobile app, contact us and also admin page. Also you can add food or more food to your basket. Then by clicking the basket icon, you can go payment page. You'll  get  details to see how much is the cost of that food also you can enter your credit card information  in that payment page, and then finish the food order. I have also added admin page and some tracking information for the orders. You can see new order and last order information in the admin page . Last thing some restaurant owner will be able to add new food
items.
